# Jasper's 5-Day Diary: The Struggles of a 17-Year-Old Sigma Wolf at Wolfy Highschool

## Monday - The "Start" of Another Week

**Dear Diary,**

Today was *so* stupid. I woke up at 11:30 AM because, as a **sigma wolf**, my circadian rhythm is an enigma to the system. I mean, who needs *normal* sleep when you can just *exist in the darkness of your soul*? Anyway, I barely made it to class, which meant I had to slip through the hallway like a shadow (with my hoodie covering my black emo hair, of course, no one can see my true potential). 

Mr. Stevens, the biology teacher, tried to talk to me about "teamwork," but I gave him my patented **glare of superiority**. Like, I'm **Jasper**, a lone wolf who doesn't need anyone. Ever. And don’t even get me started on that *alpha* Chad in my English class—Kyle. He tried to make some *eye contact* with me during the "group project" announcement, and I almost *howled* in frustration. I **do** not do group projects. 

However, I did sit alone in the cafeteria (obviously), surrounded by people who just don’t understand the *struggle* of being a **furry** in a world of humans. It’s like they don’t even get that my hoodie is a *symbol of my pain* and not just an "outfit."

Overall, a 3/10 day. But I’ll survive… as always.

## Tuesday - The "Social Experiment"

**Dear Diary,**

Today was a *testing ground* for the weak. My existential crisis grew deeper in first period as I was assigned to sit next to—*ugh*—Chad. His stupid *alpha energy* radiated like some poorly constructed YouTube motivational video, and the sheer *stupidity* of it all made me want to **run into the woods and howl in frustration**.

But then, an idea hit me: *I*—Jasper, the lone wolf—*wouldn’t just blend in* with the pack. I would disrupt it. So, I showed up late to every class and slowly started *staring at everyone* like I was planning something sinister. No one could handle the **intensity** of my black, void-like eyes. I’m like an enigma, a mystery no one can solve. 

In PE, I refused to participate in any team activity and instead just ran laps around the track. Sure, I was supposed to be doing push-ups with the *other losers*, but they were all laughing and acting like they had no *depth*, so I decided I was too **deep** to waste my time. 

After school, I went to the park and tried to *let my inner wolf out*—but then I realized I don’t even have a wolf form, because I’m just a hybrid. This is one of the many flaws in my existence that no one ever tells you about. 

**10/10 would not recommend being a hybrid.**

## Wednesday - The Day of *Revelation*

**Dear Diary,**

Today I had a *breakthrough*. I realized that the only way to truly show my dominance is to not care. I wore my hoodie inside out for no reason and didn’t speak to a single soul. *Silence is power*, after all.

During lunch, I sat at the "loser table" just to *embrace the darkness*. This was my artistic statement. It was bold. It was defiant. No one understood. *No one ever does.*

But then, something extraordinary happened. A girl—*Jessica*, the only person in this entire school who wears band shirts, like me—came over and complimented my hoodie. She said it "matched the vibe of my mysterious aura." I don't know if she was being serious or sarcastic, but I was too busy *contemplating the vastness of the universe* to respond.

I don't need anyone. But, **maybe**, if this Jessica is a true outcast like me, I’ll consider acknowledging her. We’ll see. 

**Also**, PE was horrible today. They made us play soccer, and I almost broke my foot on purpose just to avoid *interacting* with the group. But, sadly, I wasn’t so lucky.

## Thursday - *The Existential Struggle Intensifies*

**Dear Diary,**

I didn’t even *bother* going to first period today. *What’s the point?* High school is a *social construct*. We’re all just mindless sheep pretending to care. 

In History, I zoned out and doodled a wolf howling at the moon. The teacher didn’t notice, but I’m sure it was some kind of *profound commentary on the futility of human existence*. I felt pretty smart about it, tbh. 

Lunchtime came, and I took my usual spot in the corner of the cafeteria, listening to the sound of people laughing and eating—*it’s all so shallow*. If they only knew the depths of my soul. 

Later, during my solo walk home, I decided to *embrace my inner wolf* and let my primal instincts take over. I ran through the woods behind the school, shouting random *howls of defiance*. People probably think I’m insane, but they just don’t understand. I’m living on a higher plane. 

The day ended with an existential realization: **I don’t need to fit in. I’m beyond it.**

## Friday - *End of the Journey* (For Now)

**Dear Diary,**

I made it through the week. It was another triumph of *loneliness and self-doubt*, but I *survived*. I wore a black hoodie to class (like always), and I noticed people started avoiding me more. It was probably because of the **alpha energy** I was radiating. People don’t like it when someone **actually knows their worth**. 

In English, Kyle tried to challenge me in front of the class. He said I needed to "stop hiding behind the hoodie" and "engage more with the group." *What a joke.* He doesn’t even know what it’s like to be a true **lone wolf**. After school, I slammed my locker shut with my signature "I’m too cool for this" flair and walked out of Wolfy High, the **dark king** of my own destiny.

**End of week.** Another **10/10** in the bag. 

Maybe I’ll let Jessica speak to me next week. Or maybe I’ll just continue walking my own path. 

Until Monday, **diary**, when I’ll begin my next week of suffering in silence.

*Yours truly,*
