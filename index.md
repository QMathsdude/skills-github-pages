title: Welcome to my blog
---

## Why was this website created?
This is just a practice blog created using GitHub Pages, by following the tutorial [Github Pages](https://github.com/skills/github-pages).

## Challenges Faced
Some of the challenges that I faced making a website were:

- Understanding how to use **dark** custom themes.
- Slight mishap using GItHub's _Pull Request_ feature.

## Overcoming Challenges
Below are the ways I overcame [Challenges Faced](#challenges-faced):

- Searched the web on how to use dark custom themes. However, it was quite complicated. So instead, used DeepSeek to change default settings of `minima` theme to dark colour. 
- Started a new _Pull Request_ from scratch.

## Takeaways
Some takeaways after making this webpage:

- Learn more about what is Jekyll software and how it's implemented.
- Learn briefly about other types of static webpage software.
- Search for some nice themes that can be used for future webpages.
  - Learn in-depth functionality provided of these themes.
- Learn more about special files and folders that are rendered by GitHub pages.
- **Learn about CSS!!!**

## Something Fun
Below is a section called *Posts*, and it is made by creating a special file called `_posts` that works with the `minima` theme.
